# **App Name**: Mouth Metrics

## Core Features:

- User Authentication: Implement Firebase authentication for user signup, sign-in, and forgot password functionalities.
- Dashboard: Displays relevant content.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA) to convey a sense of calmness and trust.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), nearly white, provides a clean and modern backdrop that doesn't distract from the content.
- Accent color: Dusty rose (#D8BFD8) as a complementary accent for interactive elements and calls to action, providing a gentle contrast and a touch of warmth.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, is used for both headlines and body text to ensure readability and a modern, slightly warm feel throughout the application.
- Simple, geometric icons that are consistent with the clean typography. Icons should be monochromatic, using the primary color or a darker shade of the background color.
- A clean, card-based layout is used for content sections to help improve clarity.
- Subtle transitions on hover states for buttons, such as a change in background color. A progress bar will smoothly appear as user content is processed by the LLM.
